# DigitClassifyNN# MNIST Digit Classification with PyTorch

This project demonstrates a simple neural network built using PyTorch for classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.

## Steps to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnist_classification.git
    cd mnist_classification
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the main script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Project Structure

- `data_loader.py`: Contains code for loading and preprocessing the MNIST dataset.
- `model.py`: Defines the simple neural network model.
- `train.py`: Code to train the model.
- `evaluate.py`: Code to evaluate the trained model.
- `visualize.py`: (Optional) Code to visualize model predictions.
- `main.py`: Main entry point that ties everything together.

## Results

The project will output training loss and accuracy. You can also visualize the predicted digits with their labels.
